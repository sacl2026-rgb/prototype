# Greeny Alpha — IoT + Cloudflare Edge Pipeline

ESP32-WROOM-32E → Cloudflare Worker → Durable Object (WebSocket Hibernation + SQLite) → D1 → Dashboard + REST API + AI Agent.

No MQTT. No EMQX. One protocol (WSS + JSON), one API surface. Three consumers (browser dashboard, Cloudflare AI agent, Abu Desktop) speak the same language. Agent-decomposed architecture — Firmware, Edge, Dashboard, and AI are separate modules each maintainable by a dedicated AI agent with bounded context.

**Two-tier storage — the central idea:**

| Tier | Where | Latency | Blocks hibernation? | Queryable by REST? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hot path | DO-local SQLite (`ctx.storage.sql`) | Microseconds (same thread) | No — synchronous, no `await` | No (private to DO) |
| Cold path | D1 (`env.DB`) | 10–50ms (network) | Yes — `await` prevents hibernation | Yes |

The DO hibernates between telemetry messages. `webSocketMessage()` contains zero `await` calls — all storage is synchronous `ctx.storage.sql.exec()`. D1 is only touched in the alarm handler. This is the architectural insight that makes the pipeline viable at scale: Casey's GREENY calls D1 on every telemetry (4-6 round trips per message), blocking hibernation and burning quota. Our DO hibernates ~9.9 seconds out of every 10-second cycle. Verified: overnight benchmark (687 toggles, 0 failures, P50=577ms RTT).

## Sensor Calibration

### EC/TDS — Inverted Board (Off-Brand)

**The problem:** Our replacement TDS board outputs voltage that DROPS with conductivity, opposite of the DFRobot SEN0244 spec (voltage RISES). The standard cubic formula produced negative readings in tap water and near-zero readings in distilled.

**What failed (6 attempts):**
1. CAL:EC:0 commands were silently dropped — QoS 0 for calibrate, ESP32 reconnecting after each flash
2. `loadCalibration()` validation range was ±1000 — our board needs ecOffset ~2275. Every boot reset it to 0
3. `EEPROM.get()` overwrites the variable BEFORE validation — hardcoded defaults were clobbered
4. CAL:EC:VALUE formula divides by `ecRawCubic` (the cubic polynomial), which is near-zero for inverted boards in tap water — kValue exploded to huge values, producing EC=-36,000
5. kValue validation minimum was 0.1 — our computed 0.094 was rejected and reset to 1.0
6. Repeated calibrate commands during reconnect windows corrupted EEPROM with partial two-point state

**What worked:** The saved-pattern for loadCalibration (save value before EEPROM read, restore if invalid), extended validation ranges (ecOffset up to 5000, kValue down to 0.001), flipped formula `(ecOffset - ecRaw)` for inverted output, and hardcoded calibration pair (kValue=0.088, ecOffset=201) forced in setup() with EEPROM write. The board needed 5V to drive analog output — 3V3 was insufficient.

**Lessons learned:**
- Off-brand sensor boards can invert the voltage-conductivity relationship. Verify with a multimeter.
- `EEPROM.get()` is destructive — it overwrites the variable before you can validate
- Calibration commands MUST be idempotent and replay-safe, or use QoS 0 (no queue)
- The cubic polynomial breaks down for inverted boards at low voltages — a linear approximation may be better
- Never calibrate against an unknown reference (bottled water ≠ distilled)

### pH — Two-Point Calibration

**Working:** pH 4.00 and 9.18 buffers used for two-point calibration. Slope and offset stored in EEPROM (addresses 24, 28, 32). Single-point also supported via CAL:PH:4, CAL:PH:7, CAL:PH:9. Slope validated to 0.010–0.300 V/pH.

**Issues:** The old pH amplifier board powered on (green LED) but analog output was dead — 0V on the signal pin regardless of probe position. Replacement board fixed it. pH probes need 30-60 minutes of soaking after dry storage to rehydrate the glass bulb and reference junction.

### Temperature (DS18B20)
Waterproof probe on GPIO 13. OneWire + DallasTemperature library. ±0.5°C factory accuracy. Working flawlessly throughout.

## Command Forwarding — The Hibernation Bug

**The bug:** Every Cloudflare Worker deploy restarts all DO instances, dropping WebSocket connections. The ESP32 reconnects within 5 seconds, but there's a window where `this.esp32ws` is null. During this window, the old code silently dropped dashboard commands:

```
dashboard → DO → "ESP32 not connected? Discard." → command lost forever
```

**The fix:** Commands are always queued in `relay_queue` (DO-local SQLite). `drainRelayQueue` runs on every telemetry and ping — it finds queued commands and forwards them when the ESP32 reconnects. This is Casey's relay queue pattern from GREENY, moved from D1 to DO-local SQLite for zero latency.

**Additional fix:** On ESP32 reconnect, the relay queue is purged for that device. Calibration commands are context-dependent (probe position matters) — replaying a CAL:PH:4 command after a reboot when the probe is now in pH 9.18 buffer corrupts the calibration. Calibrate commands are QoS 0 (direct forward, never queued). Set_led commands are QoS 1 (queued, replayed safely).

---

## Alert Deduplication

Without deduplication, a persistent condition (pH=34.95 from disconnected probe) generates one alert per telemetry message — 43 identical alerts in 7 minutes, flooding D1.

**Fix:** Before inserting into `alert_buffer`, check if an unflushed alert of same type+device already exists. If so, skip. Reduces alert rate from 1 per 10s telemetry to 1 per 60s alarm flush — still fires while condition persists, but at 1/6 the rate.

---

## Quota Safety

| Resource | Used (typical day) | Free limit | % |
|---|---|---|---|
| DO Requests | ~1,800 | 100,000/day | 1.8% |
| DO Duration | ~550s (70 GB-s) | 13,000 GB-s/day | 0.5% |
| D1 Rows Read | Varies with history queries | 5M/day | <5% |
| D1 Rows Written | ~1,500/day (alarm flush) | 100,000/day | 1.5% |
| D1 Storage | ~2 MB | 5 GB | <0.1% |
| Workers AI | ~50 neurons/interaction | 10,000/day | <5% |

**The rows-read crisis:** An earlier version caused D1 rows-read to spike toward 90% of quota. Root cause: the `devices.last_seen` query in the alarm handler scanned ALL rows in `telemetry_buffer WHERE flushed=1` — a table that grew unbounded. Without cleanup, a week of data would produce 60K rows × 1,440 alarm cycles = 86M rows read/day. **Fix:** DELETE old flushed rows after each alarm cycle, keeping only the last 100 for the `last_seen` query.

## AI Agent — Architectural Insight

The agent lives INSIDE the DO, not beside it. It reads `ctx.storage.sql` on the same thread — microsecond latency, zero quota, zero network hops. It only calls Workers AI when a user sends a message. Watching is free.

**System prompt philosophy:** The agent doesn't just report numbers. It knows failure signatures — pH=-10 means probe disconnected, not acid spill. EC rising 2%/°C is physics, not a problem. Warm tone, plant-focused language, translates sensor data into care instructions.

**Calibration state machine:** Tracks multi-step physical workflows in `ctx.storage.sql`. Walk user through 2-point pH calibration: "put probe in pH 7.0 buffer, say ready" → records → "rinse, put in pH 4.0, say ready" → computes slope and offset → grades probe health. Same pattern unlocks nutrient dosing, reservoir flushes, sensor maintenance.

**Abu Desktop integration:** Skill file at `C:\Users\sacl2\AppData\Local\Abu\builtin-skills\greeny-alpha\SKILL.md`. Six tools mapped to REST endpoints: check plants, get history, view alerts, LED on/off, device status, health check. Uses hardcoded JWT for auth.

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Per-device DO scope.** Casey uses per-office DO (one DO for all devices in an office). We use per-device (`idFromName("esp32-sensor")`). This isolates failures — one noisy device can't block others. For single-user deployment, this is correct. For multi-tenant, Casey's per-office scope is more efficient.

2. **Inline HTML → React SPA.** The original prototype used a 400-line inline HTML string inside the Worker — zero build step, single deploy. The React SPA (forked from Casey's GREENY) replaced it for the demo. The inline dashboard still exists as fallback. The REST API supports both.

3. **Bundled Worker over Pages Functions.** Casey splits WebSocket (Worker) from REST API (Pages Functions). We consolidated into one Worker — simpler deployment, fewer moving parts. Appropriate for single-user scale.

4. **Casey protocol compat layer.** The backend accepts both our native message format (`{command:"set_led", state:true}`) and Casey's (`{type:"relay", relay1:1}`). The DO broadcasts both `{type:"state"}` (our format) and `{type:"telemetry_update"}` (Casey's format). This allowed the React fork to work with minimal changes.

5. **Arduino over ESP-IDF.** Casey's firmware is ESP-IDF in C with OLED driver, WiFi Manager, and median filtering. We use Arduino — simpler toolchain, faster iteration, one-liner compile/upload. Tradeoff: less sophisticated filtering, no WiFi Manager.

## Non-Negotiables

- `ctx.acceptWebSocket(server)` — never `server.accept()`. The latter prevents hibernation entirely.
- Zero `await` calls in `webSocketMessage()`. All hot-path storage is synchronous `ctx.storage.sql.exec()`.
- Constructor restores WebSocket connections from `ctx.getWebSockets().forEach()` + `deserializeAttachment()`. Must be zero-I/O.
- `finally { setAlarm }` — always reschedule, even on failure. Without this, 6 consecutive alarm failures permanently kill the alarm.
- Calibrate commands are QoS 0 (direct forward, never queued). set_led is QoS 1 (queued in relay_queue).
- All `loadCalibration()` values must use saved-pattern: save before `EEPROM.get()`, restore if invalid. Never trust EEPROM.
